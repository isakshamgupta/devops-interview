With your learnings in GCP and working experience in AWS, what differences did you realize? What advantages does AWS have over GCP?
-
- AWS has more mature and extensive ecosystem with a wider range of services and integrations with DevOps tools like Code pipeline, code build and cloud formation. GCP offers capabilities through code build, deployment manager and cloud functions but AWS provides deeper enterprise support and more refined IAM and networking options
- In AWS services like EC2, ASG and ELB are very mature and offer fine grained control. GCP compute engine is simpler to setup but network config and IAM policies are slightly more abstracted
- AWS IAM is very detailed and customizable while GCP IAM is more resource hierarchy based
- GCP has simpler and more predictable pricing model which is good for startups and experimental projects. AWS pricing is complex but offers more cost optimization tools like savings plans, spot instances

---------------------------------------------------------

What do you mean by cost optimization in AWS? What techniques have you used to achieve the same?
-
- Cost optimization means using cloud resources efficiently ensuring we only pay for what we use while maintaining performance and reliability. It involves analyzing, monitoring and fine tuning services to reduce unnecessary spend and make better use of AWS pricing models

- Techniques
  - Monitored EC2 instances, EBS volumes using cloudwatch and cost explorer. Identified underutilized resources and moved them to smaller instances
  - Periodically cleaned up unused EBS volumes, snapshots and elastic IPs
  - Implemented automated scripts to stop non-prod instances during off hours
  - Setup AWS budgets and cost anamoly detection alerts for monthly spending thresholds

---------------------------------------------------------

What all services have you worked on in AWS?
-
- Frequent and general question

---------------------------------------------------------

If our application is using the ECR repository, but images of multiple apps are being pushed to same ECR repo. As ECR charges us on basis of the data stored, is there any way we can optimize the storage over there? Condition is we dont want to loose images of applications and optimize the cost
-
- ECR charges us based on total image storage in GB which includes all image tags and untagged layers across repos
- When multiple apps push images to same repo, storage can grow rapidly due to duplicate images, old versions, untagged images left after deployments

- **ECR Storage Optimization Techniques**
  - Use ECR lifecycle policies to auto expire old or unused images based on rules like keep N images, delete untagged images, retain images. This ensures most recent versions of each app image are kept while older versions are cleaned up automatically
  - Set tagMutability = IMMUTABLE to prevent overwriting existing tags to avoid unnecessary re-uploading of layers and unexpected duplicate images

---------------------------------------------------------

Why are you exposing applications on EC2 insated of fargate ?
-
- Both EC2 and fargate can host containerized or web apps, the choice depends upon control, cost, scalability and use case
- We're using EC2 as our app require more control over underlying infrastructure, custom networking. Persistent configs are easier to handle with EC2
- EC2 gives us better cost optimization, ability to use custom monitoring tools and file systems which are not supported by fargate
- EC2 is preferred when we've stateful or legacy apps not fully containerized, if we need to run custom scripts

- Fargate is preferred when we need fully managed serverless containers, workload is short lived and when we dont want to manage infrastructure entirely

---------------------------------------------------------

In your career have you taken a decision related to application architecture?
-
- In one of my projects, the app was hosted on single EC2 which caused deployment downtime and scaling issues. I proposed and helped implement containerized microservice setup using docker and EKS
- We re-architected the app to use ECR for image storage, Application Load Balancer for routing, and Auto Scaling Groups for elasticity. I also designed the CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins, integrating SonarQube for code quality and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.
- This decision reduced deployment time from 20 minutes to under 5 minutes and enabled zero-downtime releases with blue-green deployment strategy. It also improved cost visibility and environment consistency across dev, QA, and prod

---------------------------------------------------------

In cloudwatch, what all things have you worked upon? 
-
- General question
- Metrics, log groups, dashboards, etc

---------------------------------------------------------

Have you worked on cloudwatch alerts? How did you configure them?
-
- Yes, I’ve worked extensively with Amazon CloudWatch to set up alerts for infrastructure and application monitoring.
- I configured CloudWatch alarms to monitor EC2 instance metrics such as CPUUtilization, DiskReadOps, and StatusCheckFailed, as well as application logs pushed via CloudWatch Logs.
- I created alarms that trigger SNS notifications whenever a metric crosses a defined threshold — for example, CPU utilization > 80% for 5 consecutive minutes. These alerts were integrated with our Slack channel using an SNS

- Cloudwatch - alarms - create - choose metrics - set threshold conditions - choose SNS topic for notification like email, SMS, slack

---------------------------------------------------------

In SNS what all options do we have for alerts?
-
- In Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service), we can send alerts or notifications through multiple delivery options — called protocols — depending on how we want to notify users or trigger actions.

- Email :- send email to subscribers email addresses
- SMS :- sends SMS to mobile numbers, text messages for users if they cannot access service/site
- SQS Queue :- sends message to amazon SQS queue

---------------------------------------------------------

Did you face any challenges in setting up SMS notifications delivery?
-
- I did face some challenges related to region restrictions, cost control and message delivery reliability
- Our SNS SMS delivery was not region specific, not all regions support SMS sending. So we had to ensure SNS topic was created in a region that support SMS
- Another challenge was SMS spending limits. We had to open ticket to increase monthly spend quota for prod alerts

---------------------------------------------------------

How did you set up the subscribers list in SNS?
-
- We setup SNS topic first and then add subscribers based on notification type email, SMS or lambda
- We can subscribe multiple endpoints like email, SMS, lambda, SQS, HTTPS
- For email or SMS receipent must confirm subscription link. Check subscriber status
- Test notifications over channels

---------------------------------------------------------

What all things in CI/CD have you worked on? 
-
- Frequent question

---------------------------------------------------------

When you do maven clean install, does that require internet access over the servers?
-
- It depends on whether all required dependencies are already available in local repos or not
- When we run mvn commands, it downloads al dependencies, plugins, parent POM from remote repos like maven central and store them at local cache
- So on fresh server or first time build, maven needs internet access

- If dependencies are already present in local, maven uses that cache. Thus maven can build without internet

- In production environments, direct internet access is usually restricted

---------------------------------------------------------

If I give you codebase of jave application, would you be able to write dockerfile for the same?
-
- If we already have JAR file built we can use below for CI to produce artifact and push to image build context

- For java application, dockerfile will look like below

<img width="659" height="281" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84ae2c63-947c-490e-a7ad-ef55e4a95c0a" />

---------------------------------------------------------

What are different cluster types in EKS?
-
- EKS supports different deployment and node management models, which effectively define types of clusters based on how the worker nodes are managed.

- Managed node groups :- Most common in prod. AWS auto handles node provisioning, integration with control plane. Nodes run on EC2 instances
- Self managed nodes :- We create and manage EC2 worker nodes manually
- Fargate profiles :- No EC2 nodes, fully serverless. AWS handles scaling, scheduling and infra

---------------------------------------------------------

We run into disaster and application goes down. You have access to EKS cluster. If I ask you to take etcd snapshot, will ot be possible?
-
- No — you cannot directly take an etcd snapshot in Amazon EKS, because etcd is managed by AWS and you don’t have access to the EKS control plane.
- In EKS, control plane is managed by AWS and is ran in AWS owned VPC without access to customers. So we cannot SSH into control plane nodes and take manual etcd snapshot

- Taking snapshot is possible in self managed K8S clusters like kubeadm

- As etcd is managed, AWS ensures auto control plane backups
- We as devops can take snapshots using CLI if workloads use EBS volumes

---------------------------------------------------------

We have K8S cluster. We've to deploy database as K8S object. Which object type can we use?
-
- You can deploy a database using a StatefulSet in Kubernetes.
- Databases need stable network identity, stable persistent storage, ordered scaling/deployment which is provided by stateful sets

- DB pods management :- stateful sets
- Storage for DB data :- PV and PVC
- DB Connection access :- service

---------------------------------------------------------

If you want to deploy same manifest yml file into AWS, is there anything we need to create for DB in AWS? Which one to use EBS or EFS?
-
- We need to make sure PV is available in AWS like EBS volumes or EBS storage class
- If we deploy DB as SS in EKS, our manifest has PVC which needs storage class that knows how to provision storage on AWS

<img width="662" height="292" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5dd3742-4ceb-4301-9a57-f054edfd02ae" />

- For DBs use EBS as it behaves like local disk and given consistent IOPS and latency. For any pod we need disk storage use EBS its RWO for gp2,gp3 type of volumes
- For inter pod communication and file sharing system, use EFS allows RWX so volume can access multiple pods

---------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between ALB and NLB?
-
- Whenever application gets request, it flows through 7 layers of OSI model and then response is processed to user
- 7 layers - Application - Presentation - Session - Transport - Network - Data Link - Physical

- ALB operates at L7 Application layer. Used to route requests based on HTTP/S. Has high latency due to L7 inspection
  - Performs LB at L7 dealing with HTTP traffic. Host or path routing is decided here
  - With ALB we can access multiple domains of website on different context paths
 
- NLB operates at L4 transport layer. Supports TCP/UDP protocols
  - Used when we dont want to perform routing depending on HTTPrequest sent to us. Whenrequest comes to L4, NLB works
  - Used in game server or youtube where least latency is expected. Data is transmitted in chunks with high transimission rate.
  - Less costly and fast compared to ALB
  - Performs routing at TCP/UDP packets
 
---------------------------------------------------------

If we have K8S cluster, can we use NLB over there?
-
- Yes we can use NLBwith AWS EKS
- AWS EKS natively supports NLB integration through K8S service LB

- AWS here auto provisions  LB in our AWS account

<img width="893" height="454" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57fa031f-5f21-4f3b-b582-3c576785f559" />

- Above creates NLB that routes external traffic to K8S service on port 80 > 8080
- As NLB works at L4, it can handle multiple requests per second

---------------------------------------------------------

I have deployment that scales upto 10 replicas and NLB has specific/static IPs that exposes those pods. What about new pods that get generated during scaling or rollout? How NLB handle this if IPs are fixed?
-
- When we create service of type LB with annotation of NLB, AWS auto creates NLB and associates it with target groups. Each EC2 in EKS becomes target in that target group
- Kube proxy on each node does node level LB to send traffic from node to correct pods

- If nw pods are creates they are scheduled onto nodes. Service's endpoints object gets updated to include those new pods
- NLB itself doesnt need to change its IPs - it already forwards traffic to registered nodes
- Node's kube proxy auto forwards incoming traffic to new pods via cluster networking

- So no changes to NLB IPs or its config are needed

---------------------------------------------------------

Write a terraform configuration script to create VPC and EC2 config using modules
-
- Frequent question

---------------------------------------------------------

I have a shell script having multiple dependncies doing server config but I want to make sure it shouldnt install already installed things again when we rerun the script in future. How can we achieve that?
-
- In script we can add pre-checks before every action

<img width="612" height="203" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1069e7ab-2aaa-4512-8f85-aa14a7834eb7" />

---------------------------------------------------------

What things have you done in shell scripting?
-
- Frequent question

---------------------------------------------------------

I want to replicate the terraform configuration into other env , how can we do it?
-
- Terraform modules
- Frequent question

---------------------------------------------------------

Command to create workspace 
-
- terraform workspace create UAT
- Frequent question

---------------------------------------------------------

What is state file in terraform? How can we maintain it remotely?
-
- Frequent question
- Remote backend using S3

---------------------------------------------------------

We are working in a team and multiple members make some changes in same terraform scripts. How can we avoid overriding the backend files?
-
- If multiple people run terraform apply or terraform plan at the same time on the same backend, the state can get corrupted or overwritten.
- Use remote backend with state locking
  - S3 + dynamoDB
  - Create S3 and DB table fro backend and locking
  - Configure backend.tf file
 
- This creates lock record in DynamoDB so no one else can modify changes of state. Lock is released when apply is complete

---------------------------------------------------------

How to handle drifts in terraform files?
-
- Drift occurs when the real infrastructure (in your cloud provider) changes outside of Terraform’s control — meaning, the actual state in AWS/Azure/GCP no longer matches what’s defined in your Terraform configuration or state file.
  - Someone manually changed an EC2 instance type in AWS Console.
  - A resource was deleted manually.
  - Auto-scaling created or destroyed infrastructure outside Terraform’s knowledge.
  - Terraform code changed, but not yet applied

- To detect drift :- terraform plan
  - to compare config files, state file and actual resources
 
- To detect drift :- terraform refresh
  - updates your state file to match the real-world infrastructure
  - After this, your terraform.tfstate file reflects the current resource values, but your code remains unchanged.
 
- To handle drift
  - Update .tf file accordingly to be in sync with config
  - you can fix it by re-applying Terraform to restore the desired configuration
 
---------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever had merge conflicts? How did you resolve them?
-
- Using git rebase. Add feature on top of master and then merge feature to master
- First pull changes from remote to local. Check conflicts. Review both versions. Update files and then push them to remote

---------------------------------------------------------

What are different merging strategies?
-
- Fast forward and 3 way merge
- Frequent question

---------------------------------------------------------

I have feature and main branch. In feature I pushed 4 changes and I want to merge one of that change into main. How can we do that?
-
- git cherry pick command $commit

---------------------------------------------------------
